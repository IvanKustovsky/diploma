# Diploma Project â€“ Equipment Rental Platform

This repository represents a diploma project developed as part of my university studies in the field of Computer Science.

The goal of the project is to build a modern **web platform for renting and leasing energy equipment**, designed using **microservice architecture** for modularity, scalability, and maintainability.

The system supports:
- User registration and authentication (via Keycloak and JWT)
- Equipment listing creation and browsing
- Rental request management
- Role-based access for users and administrators
- A containerized environment using Docker for local development and testing

For more detailed information, please refer to the separate backend and frontend repositories:
